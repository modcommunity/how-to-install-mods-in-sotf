### Nexus Mods + Vortex

Make sure you make an account on Nexus Mods if you want to use Vortex!

### Manual Installation (Advanced)
Some users may prefer manually installing mods or a mod specifically requires a manual installation. In either case, this method not recommended for beginners.

## Option 1: RedLoader + sotf-mods
If you'd like to use [RedLoader](https://www.nexusmods.com/sonsoftheforest/mods/115) to install mods from [sotf-mods](https://sotf-mods.com), please perform the following steps.

1. Download RedLoader from GitHub [here](https://github.com/ToniMacaroni/RedLoader/releases).
2. Unzip the downloaded file using built-in Windows extraction tool or 7-Zip.
3. All contents from unzipped file should now be copied to Sons of The Forest's main game location (the `_RedLoader` folder should end up being in the same directory as `SonsOfTheForest.exe` executable).
4. Find a mod from [sotf-mods.com](https://sotf-mods.com), go to its page, and if the **Install with Red Manager** button isn't grayed out, click it.
5. The RedLoader tool should now pop up and add the mod.
6. Launch Sons of The Forest and test out your newly installed mods!

## Option 2: Thunderstore + r2modman
To browse and find mods from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/sons-of-the-forest/) and install them using [`r2modman`](https://thunderstore.io/c/sons-of-the-forest/p/ebkr/r2modman/), please follow the below steps.

1. Download `r2modman` from [here](https://thunderstore.io/c/sons-of-the-forest/p/ebkr/r2modman/).
2. Launch the tool and select **Sons of The Forest** as the game.

4. If you don’t have BepInEx installed, but want it:
   * Download it from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/sons-of-the-forest/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack_IL2CPP/)
